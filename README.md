EXP 2: Evaluation of Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta

## AIM:

Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## AI TOOLS REQUIRED:

 ChatGPT-4.5 / GPT-4-turbo (OpenAI)
 Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) (Anthropic)
 Gemini (Bard) (Google)
 Cohere Command R+ / R+ Light
 Meta LLaMA 3-based models (e.g., via Mistral/Perplexity.ai, or Meta's own interfaces)

## INTRODUCTION TO PROMPTING TOOLS IN AI PLATFORMS:

As artificial intelligence systems—particularly large language models (LLMs)—have become more sophisticated and widely adopted, the art and science of prompt engineering has emerged as a critical practice. Prompting tools are techniques, frameworks, or software utilities designed to optimize the interaction between users and AI models by crafting clear, structured, and goal-aligned input prompts.
Prompting is more than simply asking a question; it involves framing input in a way that guides the AI system to generate relevant, accurate, and context-aware responses. Given that most foundation models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google's Gemini (formerly Bard), Cohere’s Command R, and Meta's LLaMA are general-purpose, their performance is highly sensitive to how prompts are structured.
To address this, various prompting tools and strategies have been developed to enhance model output quality across tasks such as question answering, code generation, reasoning, summarization, and more. 
These include:
Zero-shot prompting – giving the model a task without examples.
Few-shot prompting – providing a few examples to guide the model.
Chain-of-thought prompting – encouraging step-by-step reasoning.
Instructional prompting – using clear directives like "explain," "summarize," or "compare."
Role-based prompting – assigning the AI a persona or context (e.g., “You are a lawyer…”).
Self-reflective prompting – asking the model to critique or improve its own answer.
In parallel, platform-specific tools (like OpenAI’s function calling, Claude's system prompts, and Gemini's context-aware responses) offer even deeper control over model behavior.
As organizations and individuals seek to leverage AI for increasingly complex tasks, the ability to use and refine these prompting tools becomes a key determinant of success. Understanding how different prompting approaches affect model outputs across various AI platforms is essential for developers, researchers, and users alike.
